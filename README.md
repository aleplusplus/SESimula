<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
The Software SESimula, designed to serve as a support tool for the course Introduction to Simulation in this sense, should recognize several significant aspects that allow the new software, expect a greater number of features that the software Sim 1.0 Tuto currently it provides support in the subject.
</p>
<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
SESimula has implemented 36 random number generators, excelling and MacLaren and Marsaglia Park - Miller shuffling using the method. Smirnov and Chi square implementing the Sim Tuto, the Gaps, quadratic and Distances Series - the new software in addition to the Kolmogorov provided. We have implemented a total of 36 distribution functions, 20 more than the Sim Tuto 1.0, which allows all the contents of the first issue of the subject. The software has a module that allows the modeling and design of discrete stochastic processes, using the strategy event-driven simulation, which provides a tool for simulations. In developing this system using the Qt platform allows the same platform and is freely distributed, which facilitates its use in other races, and science as a tool.
